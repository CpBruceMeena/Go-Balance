# Load Balancer Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview
A modern, scalable load balancer built in Go that supports multiple clusters and provides a user-friendly web interface built with React.js. The system will handle traffic distribution across multiple backend servers while providing essential features like rate limiting, timeouts, and health checks. The web interface will be served as static files from the Go backend.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Load Balancing
- Support for multiple load balancing algorithms:
  - Round Robin (Default)
    - Distributes requests sequentially across all available servers
    - Maintains a counter to track the next server to receive traffic
  - Least Connections
    - Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections
    - Requires tracking active connections per server
  - Weighted Round Robin
    - Similar to Round Robin but with configurable weights per server
    - Higher weight means more traffic allocation
  - IP Hash
    - Routes requests based on client IP address hash
    - Ensures same client always reaches same server
- Health checks for backend servers
  - HTTP/HTTPS health check endpoints
  - Configurable check intervals (default: 30s)
  - Configurable timeout (default: 5s)
  - Configurable success/failure thresholds
- Automatic failover
  - Immediate removal of unhealthy servers
  - Automatic re-addition when healthy
- Session persistence (sticky sessions)
  - Cookie-based session tracking
  - Configurable session timeout
- SSL/TLS termination
  - Support for multiple SSL certificates
  - SNI support
  - Automatic certificate renewal

### 2.2 Cluster Management
- Create and manage multiple clusters
- Each cluster can have its own:
  - Set of backend servers
    - Add/remove servers dynamically
    - Configure server weights
    - Set server-specific timeouts
  - Load balancing algorithm
  - Rate limiting rules
  - Timeout configurations
  - SSL certificates
- Cluster isolation
  - Separate configuration per cluster
  - Independent scaling
  - Isolated monitoring

### 2.3 Rate Limiting
- Per-cluster rate limiting
  - Global cluster limits
  - Per-server limits

  - Requests per second (default: 100)
  - Requests per minute (default: 1000)
  - Requests per hour (default: 10000)
- Custom rate limit rules based on:
  - IP address
  - Path
  - HTTP method
  - Custom headers
- Rate limit response
  - Configurable status code (default: 429)
  - Custom response headers
  - Retry-After header support

### 2.4 Timeouts
- Connection timeout (default: 5s)
- Read timeout (default: 30s)
- Write timeout (default: 30s)
- Idle timeout (default: 60s)
