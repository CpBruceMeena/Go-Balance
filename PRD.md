# Load Balancer Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview
A modern, scalable load balancer built in Go that supports multiple clusters and provides a user-friendly web interface for configuration and monitoring. The system will handle traffic distribution across multiple backend servers while providing essential features like rate limiting, timeouts, and health checks.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Load Balancing
- Support for multiple load balancing algorithms:
  - Round Robin
  - Least Connections
  - Weighted Round Robin
  - IP Hash
- Health checks for backend servers
- Automatic failover
- Session persistence (sticky sessions)
- SSL/TLS termination

### 2.2 Cluster Management
- Create and manage multiple clusters
- Each cluster can have its own:
  - Set of backend servers
  - Load balancing algorithm
  - Rate limiting rules
  - Timeout configurations
  - SSL certificates

### 2.3 Rate Limiting
- Per-cluster rate limiting
- Per-IP rate limiting
- Configurable rate limits:
  - Requests per second
  - Requests per minute
  - Requests per hour
- Custom rate limit rules based on:
  - IP address
  - Path
  - HTTP method
  - Custom headers

### 2.4 Timeouts
- Connection timeout
- Read timeout
- Write timeout
- Idle timeout
- Per-cluster timeout configurations

### 2.5 Web UI Features
- Dashboard with real-time metrics
- Cluster management interface
- Server management interface
- Configuration management
- Real-time monitoring
- Log viewer
- Alert configuration

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Backend (Go)
- RESTful API for UI communication
- gRPC support for internal communication
- Metrics collection using Prometheus
- Structured logging
- Configuration management using YAML/JSON
- Hot reload support for configuration changes
- Graceful shutdown support

### 3.2 Frontend (Web UI)
- Modern, responsive design
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Interactive dashboards
- Easy-to-use configuration forms
- Visual representation of cluster health
- Server status monitoring
- Traffic visualization

### 3.3 Security
- Authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control
- API key management
- SSL/TLS support
- IP whitelisting/blacklisting
- DDoS protection

## 4. Performance Requirements
- Support for at least 10,000 concurrent connections
- Response time < 100ms for load balancing decisions
- Support for at least 100 backend servers per cluster
- Support for at least 10 clusters
- Memory usage < 1GB per cluster
- CPU usage < 50% under normal load

## 5. Monitoring and Logging
- Real-time metrics collection
- Request/response logging
- Error logging
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization metrics
- Alert system for:
  - Server failures
  - High latency
  - Rate limit breaches
  - Resource exhaustion

## 6. Deployment Requirements
- Docker support
- Kubernetes deployment support
- Configuration via environment variables
- Health check endpoints
- Easy scaling capabilities

## 7. Future Enhancements
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) integration
- CDN integration
- Advanced traffic shaping
- Custom plugin system
- API gateway features
- Service discovery integration

## 8. Success Metrics
- System uptime > 99.9%
- Response time < 100ms
- Zero configuration errors
- Successful handling of traffic spikes
- User satisfaction with UI/UX
- Easy cluster management
- Accurate monitoring and alerting

## 9. Development Phases
